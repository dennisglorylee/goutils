# Introduction

This repository aims to provide Golang developers with a series of practical and easy-to-use tools to help them improve development efficiency and work efficiency. These tools cover various fields, including algorithm libraries, container libraries, storage tools, file processing, Http and Websocket networks, NoSql database access, etc.

# Features
- Solution positioning: Based on solving tedious tasks outside the microservice framework, it forms a differentiated complement with the development framework.
- Easy to integrate: low connection, can be integrated with various projects, such as go-zero.
- Function focus: The tool library theme implements tools for various common functions. In order to avoid reinventing the wheel without developing your own SQL ORM, make more use of the powerful ORM solutions of the open source community. Only by standing on the shoulders of giants can you go further.
